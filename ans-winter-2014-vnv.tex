\section{Introduction}

PyNE \cite{scopatz_pyne} (formerly Python for Nuclear Engineering) is a
transinstitutional, open source project consisting of a collection of
computational tools pertinent to nuclear engineering analysis and simulations.
The capabilities of PyNE include canonical nuclide and reaction naming
conventions, material handling, nuclear data and cross-section reading, mesh
operations, and physics-code-specific input and output parsing. % add to this list

Within the nuclear industry, many applications require software to that meets
the quality assurance (QA) criteria set forth by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory
Commission (NRC). The NRC endorses the American Society of Mechanical Engineers
(ASME) NQA-1-2008 regulatory standard \emph{Quality Assurance Requirements for
Nuclear Facility Applications} (Parts I and II) \cite{nrc} with the NQA-1a-2009
addendum \cite{add} for the design and construction of nuclear power plants and
fuel reprocessing facilities \cite{nrc}. Unsurprisingly, tne portions of these
documents pertinent to software development and documentation outline a
software engineering development model that is structured somewhat differently
from community-oriented software development model adopted by PyNE. 

\textcolor{red}{Insert Anthony's portion on different software development
workflows e.g. waterfall, agile. The first sentence of the next paragraph needs
up be revised for flow but the one above looks pretty solid.}

Organizations that seek to comply with NQA-1-2008/NQA-1-2009a can use any
portion of PyNE (or code from any source for that matter) as a component of
their design and or operations software by complying with Part II Subpart 2.7
Par. 302 ``Otherwise Acquired Software." This section provides provisions the
use of "... freeware ... " that "has not been previously approved under a
program consisent with [the NQA-1 standard]." In addition, PyNE seeks to
demarcate modules for which the developement process and documentation are
fully compliant with such standards. As it turns out, the PyNE software
developement practices accomplish the same goals as these standards.  When a
module reaches a logical point of completion, a few additional steps can be
taken to make the module full compliant, and it can be delineated accordingly.

This paper presents the strategy implemented by PyNE to ensure that
open-source, community-developed, code is developed in a manor compliant with
regulatory standards. The requirement of ASME-1-2008/ASME-1a-2009 are addressed
explicitly. Finally the additional documentation necessary for full compliance
is discussed. These efforts mean PyNE code can be more easily used within a
broader subset of the nuclear engineering field.

%% ADD:
% emphasis that even complying in-spirit is great!


\section{PyNE Software Development Practices}

The PyNE software development workflow is meticulous, systematic, and similar
to that of prominent and well-established projects such as the Linux kernel.
The PyNE workflow is centered around Git distributed version control software
and additional features provided by the Github Git repository hosting service.
The \texttt{develop} and \texttt{master} branches of this repository represent
a software baseline: a collection of software that gone through the review and
approval process and cannot be changed without going though the change process.
All PyNE code, tests, and documentation source code are stored in a public
reposition on Github. The PyNE website (\texttt{http://pyne.io}) is home to the
rendered documentation, which includes a user's guide, developers guide, style
guide, as well as application programming interface (API) documentation.
Question about PyNE are posed on the PyNE user and develop mailing list.

In order to make changes (e.g. new features, documentation improvements, and
bug fixes), a development must first make changes on his/her own version of the
repository (fork) and issue a Github \emph{pull request}. A pull request is a
request for changes from a developer's fork to be applied to the main
repository. The acceptance of PR is contingent on a formal review process. A
review submits a pull request, acompanied by a description of the changes made.
Then, another developer (who did not participate in the writing of the changes)
reviews the changes, line-by-line, verifying the changes are consistent with
the requesters description of the changes and compliant with the PyNE
developer's guide and the PyNE Style guide. In addition, the reviewer must
ensure that that all unit tests pass (there are more than 700), and that
additional features implemented by the PR are matches with additional unit
tests. Pull requests are generally iterative processes were requesters update
requests based of off the criticism of the reviewer. Once the reviewer, or
reviewer(s) are satisfied, the PR is accepted, and the newest version of the
code becomes the baseline.

%300,000 lines of code and 700 unit tests

\subsection{Nightly Testing and Continuous Integration} 

In addition to human verification via pull request code review, the PyNE
workflow includes both nightly testing and Continuous Integration (CI) to
guarantee that the code base is consistently and constantly tested and
validated. It is important to maintain confidence with the current version of
the updated code base being actively developed. PyNE uses a branching
development strategy, where the \textit{develop} branch corresponds to the
actively developed and updated code base.

The practice of Continuous Integration is a well known software engineering
practice first conceived by Beck and Jefferies \cite{beck1998extreme} that
espouses updating shared code bases in a rapid manner in order streamline the
shared development process. A key component of modern CI approaches is the
automated building and testing of a code base upon reception of a proposed
change (i.e., a patch). For each proposed patch, the entire patched code base is
built on one or more platforms (e.g., a flavor of Linux, a Mac Operating System
(OS), or a Windows OS), and some number of unit, integration, and regression
tests are executed. The quantity of tests run with each patch submission is
dependent on the amount of time required for their execution, allowing for
relatively quick knowledge of success or failure. The proposed patch is then only
accepted if building and testing passes on all supported platforms and the
reviewer is content with both the patch's style and content. PyNE enforces a CI
approach for any patch that is proposed to be merged into the \textit{develop}
branch.

While CI is designed to streamline the integration process, nightly testing is a
complimentary tool that verifies and validates the code base once each 24-hour
period. Each nightly test is run on one or more platforms. On a clean version of
each platform, all dependencies are installed, and the entire code base is built
and installed. All unit, integration, and regression tests are then run. A
common practice among software projects is to update all supported develop
binaries after a successful nightly build and test execution

\subsubsection{PyNE's Implementation}

PyNE utilizes the Build and Test Lab (BaTLab) \cite{batlab_2014} as its general
building and testing service. BaTLab provides the basic tools required to
install a project and its dependencies, test a project, and return any built
products. While PyNE builds and tests both the nightly builds and CI using
Ubuntu 12(.04) and MacOS 10.8, supports all of the following platforms:

\begin{table}[ht]

    \caption{\label{tab::batlab}Build and testing platforms supported by BaTLab. 
      Those utilized by PyNE are denoted with an asterisk (*).}

    \hline
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
\end{table}

PyNE uses BaTLab's services directly for its nightly testing. Scripts were
developed that nightly install PyNE's dependencies, download the current version
of PyNE's \textit{develop} branch, install PyNE, and run all tests in the PyNE
code base. Upon completion, the PyNE developer mailing list is notified in case of
any failures.

The implementation of Continuous Integration is more complicated, because it
must communicate with PyNE's repository management service, GitHub, and a build
and test service. There exist a number of CI services, such as TravisCI
\cite{travis_2014}; however, many have limitations in either their number and
type of supported platforms or constrained total building and testing time. PyNE
utilizes Polyphemus \cite{polyphemus_2014}, a plugin-based CI service that can
connect with any supported front end (e.g. Github) and back end (e.g. BaTLab).

The PyNE development team runs a Polyphemus server that utilizes its BaTLab
scripts to build and test all proposed patches to PyNE's \textit{develop}
branch. A patch proposal is initiated via GitHub's pull request
interface. The Polyphemus server is then notified, causing the launch of a
BaTLab job. Upon completion of the BaTLab job, the server is again notified and
updates Github with the result. Finally, active and prior jobs can be monitored
via a continuously running \href{http://gorgus.pyne.io/dashboard}{dashboard}.


\section{Addressing NQA-1-2008/NQA-1a-2009}

NQA-1-2008/NQA-1a-2009 contain two sections pertinent to nuclear engineering
software development. In Part I: ``Requirements for Quality Assurance Programs
for Nuclear Facilities," Requirement 3 Section 800 addresses ``Software Design
Control" and is unrevised by the 2009 addendum. The second portion is Part II:
"Quality Assurance Requirements for Facility Applications", Subpart 2.7:
``Quality Assurance Requirements for Computer Software for Nuclear
Applications." The second part is meant to a supplement Part I. A revised
edition to Subpart 2.7 appears in-full in NQA-1a-2009. The software development
practices of PyNE can be mapped to the criterion set forth by these documents.
The section heading below refer to pertainent items within these documents.

\subsection{NQA-1-2008 Part I Requirement 3 Section 800: Software Design Control}

\subsubsection{801 Design Process}

% This portion is written presuming Anthony as already is described the Waterfall method.
The design process suggested by Section 801 is essentially the Waterfall method, which requires documentation of, following, described in Pars. 801.1-801.5:
\begin{enumerate} 
\item{Requirements}
\item{Software Design}
\item{Implimentaion}
\item{Software Design Verification}
\item{Computer Program Testing}
\end{enumerate}

In PyNE, \emph{requirements} typically appear in description of changes made in
a pull request. The \emph{software design} is found in documentation strings of
all functions and classes, which then becomes part of the API documentation.
The \emph{implimentation} is scruntized when pull-requested code is assess for
conformality with the style guide. \emph{computer progream testing} is easily covered with unit testing and continuous integration.

\subsubsection{802 Software Configuration Management}

In this section describes what needs to be documented, and consists of three requirments: configuration identification, change control, and status control. Configuration identification constitutes being able uniquely identify each version of the codes, as well as determine the differences between version. Since all codes, tests, and documentation in PyNE is version control with Git, this is automatic. Change control means that changes need 

802.1 Configuration Identification - be able to identify each revision and diff them - git version control
802.2 Change Control - document and justify all changes - as stated in the PyNE dev guide, all changes must be made via PR. We only give push access to individually who prove adept and consent to this responsibility.
802.3 Status Control - that status of each configuration (version) and documenting changes that are improved but not implemented - we have version control and also GitHub issues.

\subsection{NQA-1a-2009 Part II: Subpart 2.7}

\subsection{Section 200 General Requirements}

201 Documentation - baseline documents retained as record.
202 Review  - two are required: 1) the process leading to acceptance testing, and verifying acceptance testing works. However this can be done at the same time.
203 Software Configuration Management - documentation, programs, and support software must be controlled, as well as the process of approving and accepting changes. We version control our code and our documentation.
204 Problem reporting and corrective action - we have GitHub "bug" issues and a user and dev mailing list.

\subsection{300 Software Acquisition}
301 Procured Software and Acquired Service - does not apply, we get everything for free
302 Otherwise Acquired Software - understand the capabilities and limitations of the software, demonstrate them, instruction for use within limits, justify any exceptions to the V\&V workflow

we've got a lot of dependencies -- our unit tests are their regression tests.

\subsection{400 Software Engineering Method}
Software engineering methods should be documented.
