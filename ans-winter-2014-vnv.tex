\section{Introduction}

PyNE (formally Python for Nuclear Engineering) is a transinstitutional, open
source project consisting of a collection of computational tools pertinent to
nuclear engineering analysis and simulations. The capabilities of PyNE include
canonical nuclide and reaction naming conventions, material handling, nuclear
data and cross-section reading, mesh operations, and physics-code-specific
input and output parsing. Within the nuclear industry, many applications
require software to that meets the quality assurance (QA) criteria set forth by
the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). The NRC endorses the American
Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) NQA-1-2008 regulatory standard
\emph{Quality Assurance Requirements for Nuclear Facility Applications} (Parts
I and II) \cite{nrc} with the NQA-1a-2008 addendum \cite{add} for the design
and construction licensing phases of nuclear power plants and fuel reprocessing
facilities \cite{nrc}. The portions of these documents pertaint to software
development and documentation outline a software engineering development model
that is incongruent with the community-orienteed software developement model
adopted by PyNE, which presents novel change of bringing open-source,
community-developed, code up to regulatory standards.

over 300,000 lines of code and documentation and over 700 unit tests.


Ultimatly, PyNE is an organization that




Be sure to note that PyNE code can only be a component of a V\&V process, which
is ultimatly carried out by an analysist. In most cases, PyNE is ``Otherwise
Acquired Software", which is subject to same criterion, but not all of it is
applicable. For example, ``Operation" and ``System Software".

\section{Addressing the Criteria of NQA-1-2008}

PyNE is systematic, meticulous, and downright pedantic.
This PyNE workflow as described in the dev guide is very close to V\&V. Maybe not letter for letter (which would require waterfall), but certainly in spirit! 
This may not be obvious to the uninitaited, so this paper spells it out.

V\&V is both a process and collection of documentation. We follow the practice daily. We won't remove import gaurds until all documentation is preceent.

Part I: Requirements for Quality Assurance Programs for Nuclear Facilities

No relevant additions from the 2009 Addendum.

Requirement 3 of Part I is Design contronl
Section 800 of Requirement 3 is Software Design Control 
Paragraph (Par.) 801 describes the waterfall method:
801.1 Requirments - The first line of every doc string provide the purpose of the 
801.2 Software Design - document the design of the software - API documentation
801.3 Implementaion - use the standards an conventions of the organization - we have style guide and dev guide
801.4 Software Design Verification - must be preformed by an individual that did not write the code  - we have pull request code reviews.
801.5 Computer program testing - we have unit tests and CI

Par. 802 Software Configuration Managment
802.1 Configuration Identification - be able to identify each revision and diff them - git version control
802.2 Change Control - document and justify all changes - as stated in the PyNE dev guide, all changes must be made via PR. We only give push access to individualy who prove adept and consent to this responsibilty.
802.3 Status Control - that status of each configuration (version) and documenting changes that are improved but not implimented - we have verison control and also github issues.


Part II: Quality Assurance Requirements for Facility Applications
Subpart 2.7: Quality Assurance Requirements for Computer Software for Nuclear Applications.
This is ment as a suppliment to Part I Requirement 3. -- In our case it is redundent, but would not necessarily be the case for all workflows.

Section 200 General Requirement
201 Documentation - baseline documents retained as record.
202 Review  - two are required: 1) the process leading to acceptance testing, and verifying acceptance testing works. However this can be done at the same time.
203 Software Configuration Management - documentation, programs, and support software must be controlled, as well as the process of approving and accepting changes. We version control our code and our documentation.
204 Problem reporting and corrective action - we have github "bug" issues and a user and dev mailing list.



300 Software Acquistion
301 Procured Software and Aquired Service - does not apply, we get everything for free
302 Otherwise Acquired Software - understand the capabilities and limitations of the software, demostrate them, instruction for use within limits, justify any exceptions to the V\&V workflow

we've got a lot of dependencies -- our unit tests are there regression tests.

400 Software Engineering Method
Software engineering methods should be documented.
- This portion may be redundent
401 Design requirements should be traceable
402 Software design verificaiton
403 Implimentation
404 Acceptance testing
405 Operation - up to the user!

500 Standards, Conventions, and Other Work practices. style/dev guide

Security

600 Support software - out of scope. we don't control what other softwared users used. 



\section{Conclusion}

As software development changes, requirements need to change to reflect this.
