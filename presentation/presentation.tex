Part I: “Requirements for Quality Assurance Programs for
Nuclear Facilities,

Pars. 801.1-801.5:
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Requirements - the scope of the capabilities implemented by the work.}
\item{Software design - the mathematical and computational methodologies employed to meet the requirements.}
\item{Implementation - writing code using the standards and conventions agreed upon by the organization.}
\item{Software design verification - independent confirmation that requirements are met.}
\item{Computer program testing - comparison of results produced by the work to expected or known results.}
\end{enumerate}

configuration identification - identify each version of the code and the difference between them
configuration change control - document changes to the baseline as well as justifiction/verification
configuration status control - accounted for prior to being incorporated into the baseline and changes that are “proposed and approved, but not implemented” are documented \cite{add}

Part II
Subpart 2.7 Section 302, “Otherwise Acquired Software.”
This section provides provisions for the use of “freeware”

consistent with [the NQA-1 standard]”

Verify it yourself!

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Requirements for Pull Requests}
In order to be accepted:
\begin{itemize}
\item{Unit tests that cover any new features.}
\item{All preexisting}
\item{Inline documentation}
\item{Format compliant with the PyNE Style guide.}
\end{itemize}

\frametitle{Nightly testing Continuous Integration}

Nightly testing -- install PyNE's dependies, install PyNE, run the tests.
- PyNE mailing list is notified in the case of any failures.

Ubuntu 12, Scientific Linux 6, Mac OSX 8, Ubuntu 10 with Python 3.

Continuous integration:

BatLab and GitHub connected with Polyphemus server

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{The PyNE QA standard}

Currently applied to indiviual modules.

Everything heretofor has been the bare minimum to be accpeted into PyNE

The module has a theory manual entry that describes or cites all non-trivial mathematics and/or physics that occur within a module, and also lists the assumptions and limitations of the module.

The module is fully unit tested, with test coverage that spans the entire set of capabilities described in the theory manual. If the expected results of unit tests require non-trivial calculations, sample calculations should be provided in the theory manual. In other words, any numbers that appear in the unit tests must be reproducible.

The module has a user manual entry that describes how to use its functionality within the design basis.

If modules contain significant physics (e.g. transport, transmutation), the module must be benchmarked against experimental results, with appropriate uncertainty and sensitivity analysis. In addition, regression tests must be incorporated into the CI.

When removal of an import guard is proposed in a pull-request, both the requester and reviewer should be prepared to justify the decision to merge, in the event that the module falls under scrutiny.
